WELCOME to Biophysical Essentials !
Biophysical Essentials is an open-source software framework written in Python QT. It enables researchers to analyze biophysical data, such as Patch-Clamp recordings from amplifiers made by different companies, including HEKA, Sutter, Axon, and more.

Please find our research published in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Volume 255: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108328. If you use BPE in your research, please cite the paper as: D. Zimmermann, M. Kress, and M. Zeidler, “Biophysical essentials – A full stack open-source software framework for conserved and advanced analysis of patch-clamp recordings,” Comput Methods Programs Biomed, vol. 255, p. 108328, Oct. 2024, doi: 10.1016/J.CMPB.2024.108328.

A full documentation and additional tutorials can be found on the BPE-project homepage at https://biophysical-essentials.i-med.ac.at. On this webiste, you can also find the software download with the demo data included.
